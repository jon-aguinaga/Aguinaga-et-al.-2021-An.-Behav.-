A R markdown file that explores the theoretical implications of how the social environmnent effects an individual's assessment of environmental quality. 

Behavioral decision-making is often comprised of two distinct 'phases', an assessment phase followed by a decision phase. In the assessment phase, individuals collect information both privately and socially to update their perception of the quality of options or choices. In the decision phase, an individual uses some pre-determined rule to make a choice based on available information. Experiments in behavioral ecology largely focus on decision-making because it is observable to the researcher, with the assessment phase being largely ignored. 

In this study, I develop a mathematical model to evaluate how the social environment, and the information it produces, influences the accuracy of an individuals assessment of environmental quality by measuing it against the 'true' value of the enviroment, which is unknown to agents.

To execute this code, you will need R and Rstudio and the associated packages found at the start of the code.
